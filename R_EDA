##--------------------- CUSTOMER_CHURN_EDA-----------------------------------------------------------#


## Subscription based services typically make money in the following three ways:
  
## Acquire new customers
## Upsell customers
## Retain existing customers

## In this article I'm going to focus on customer retention. 
## To do this, I'm going to perform an exploratory analysis, and do some basic data cleaning.

## I'll generate some questions focused on customer segments to help guide the analysis. 
## Based off of the insights gained, I'll provide some recommendations for improving customer retention.

# Lets check the Datatypes of the features 
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(df)

# Lets Look at Missing Values 

colSums(is.na(df))

# It looks like "TotalCharges" is the only feature with missing values. 
# Lets go ahead and impute the 11 missing values using the median value.


# imputing with the median
library(dplyr)
df <- df %>%
  mutate(TotalCharges = replace(TotalCharges,
                                is.na(TotalCharges),
                                median(TotalCharges, na.rm = T)))

# checking that the imputation worked
sum(is.na(df$TotalCharges))


# --------------------- DATA EXPLORATION ----------------------------------------------------------#

# Let's start by taking a look at the unique values of the factor variables

df_tbl <- df %>%
  select_if(is.factor) %>%
  summarise_all(n_distinct)

df_tbl


# --------------------


# To guide the analysis, I'm going to try and answer 
# the following questions about my customer segments:
  
  # Are men more likely to churn than women?
  # Are senior citizens more like to churn?
  # Do individuals with a partner churn more than those without a partner?
  # Do people with dependents churn more than people that do not have dependents?
  

# Lets Start Exploring Gender Variable  
  
# I wouldn't expect one gender to be more likely than another to churn, but lets see what the data shows.


STAT::STAT() 

# using bar plot lets visualise the data 

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(df) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = gender, fill = Churn), position = "dodge")

table(df$gender,df$Churn)

# Taking a look, the results are similar. Roughly one quarter of the male customers churn, and roughly one quarter of the female customers churn. 


# LEts take the look at Senior Citizens

ggplot(df) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = SeniorCitizen, fill = Churn), position = "dodge")

# We can see the exact value by using table command .

table(df$SeniorCitizen,df$Churn)

# This variable shows a much more meaningful relationship. 
# Roughly 16% of the customers are senior citizens, and roughly 42% of those senior citizens churn. 
# On the other hand, of the 84% of customers that are not senior citizens, only 24% churn. 
# These results show that senior citizens are much more likely to churn.



# Now I'm going to take a look at people with partners.

ggplot(df) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=Partner, fill = Churn), position = "dodge")

# Now lets look at exact values .

table(df$Partner,df$Churn)

# Roughly half of the people have partners. Of the people with partners, 20% churn. 
# For people without partners, approximately 33% churn.


# Next, I'll take a look at the Dependents category.

ggplot(df) +
  geom_bar(aes_string(x="Dependents", fill="Churn"), position = "dodge")

# Lets look at the exact value

table(df$Dependents,df$Churn)

# Approximately 30% of the people have dependents, of which 15% churn. 
# For the other 70% that don't have dependents, 31% churn.



# Lets compare the customer segements so that we can identify where we would potentially focus our efforts.

# Total charges and tenure of senior citizens

library(dplyr)

df1 <- df %>%
  filter(SeniorCitizen == '1', Churn == "Yes")
  

View(df1)

sum(df1$TotalCharges) # Total Charges = 882405.20 



# Total charges and tenure of people without a partner
df2 <- df %>%
  filter(Partner == "No", Churn == "Yes")

view(df2)

sum(df2$TotalCharges) # Total Charges = 1206776


# Total charges and tenure of people without a dependents

df3 <- df %>%
  filter(Dependents == "No", Churn == "Yes")

view(df3)

sum(df3$TotalCharges) # Total Charges = 2261840

# Based on the results, we should focus our efforts on people without dependents. 
# This customer segment that churned had nearly 2.3MM in total charges compared to 1.3MM for people without partners, 
# and only 900K for senior citizens.



# Lets take the Look at Payment Method 

attach(df)
df <- as.data.frame(df)

ggplot(df) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=PaymentMethod,fill=Churn), position = "dodge")
# Maximum curn is by electronic check .



# Lets take the look at phone Service

ggplot(df) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=PhoneService, fill = Churn), position = "dodge")

table(df$PhoneService,df$Churn)

# A lot of people with phone service churned. 
# Maybe these people don't really use the phone service. 
# Moving them to a plan without phone service to save them some money on their bill might help retain them.




# Lets Look at Internet Service

ggplot(df) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=InternetService, fill = Churn), position = "dodge")

table(df$InternetService,df$Churn)

# People with fiber optic internet churned much more than people with DSL or no internet at all.
# Maybe moving some of those people to DSL or eliminating their internet service would be an option. 





# Lets take the Look at Online Security , Online Backup and Device Protection


ggplot(df) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=OnlineSecurity, fill = Churn), position = "dodge")

ggplot(df) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=OnlineBackup, fill = Churn), position = "dodge")

ggplot(df) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=DeviceProtection, fill = Churn), position = "dodge")


table(df$OnlineSecurity,df$Churn)
table(df$OnlineBackup,df$Churn)
table(df$DeviceProtection,df$Churn)


# People without online backup, device protection, and online security churn fairly frequently. 
# Maybe their devices have crashed, causing them to lose valuable files. 
# They may have also experienced fraud or identity theft that has left them very unhappy. 
# Moving these people to some of these services may help safeguard their systems.




# Let us Visualise to those people having Tech Support

ggplot(df) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=TechSupport, fill = Churn), position = "dodge")

table(df$TechSupport,df$Churn)

# Those without tech support tend to churn more frequently than those with tech support. 
# Moving customers to tech support accounts might be another potential way to prevent churn.
